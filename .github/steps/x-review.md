## Review üëì

Congratulations! You've completed the `creme-brulee` ComplyTime learning course and learned a lot about the supporting projects. You learned about the projects that build the foundation for ComplyTime tools and how the `oscal-content` repository synchronizes the `ComplianceAsCode/content` with the `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content`.

**Here's a recap of your accomplishments:**

- Expanded your knowledge on interacting with GitHub through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- Learned about the open-source projects that contribute to automating compliance management workflows.
- Took notes on the ComplyTime projects and tools using markdown and Git flow.
- Learned about the `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content` repository and the bidirectional synchronization with `ComplianceAsCode/content` thanks to `complyscribe`.

### What's next? ‚è≠Ô∏è

- Review what you learned in your copy of the `creme-brulee` ComplyTime learning course. The issue that was automatically created when you first clicked "Start Exercise" is now in the same "Issues" tab, but once you opened the issue for taking notes - it was moved to "Closed." Find your issue under the "Closed" tab.
- Retry this exercise! Practicing only helps here. This is a public repository template so you can retry this exercise as often as you'd like. 
- Ask questions. The Slack channel for the learning course will be [#learn-complytime](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C093B45QGQM)
